# Thermosensory Calcium Imaging Matlab Code
 This repository subfolder contains Matlab code related to preprocessing and quantification of data collected during thermosensory calcium imaging experiments. 
 
 For analysis of experiments in *C. elegans* AFD and *S. stercoralis* AFD, the top-level Matlab script is: TCI_Primary.m 
 
 For analysis of rGC ecoptic expression experiments in *C. elegans* ASE, the users should preprocess imaging data and temperature recordins using TCI_Preprocess.m before conducting quantification and plotting using the TCI_analyzeEctopic.m file.
