# Thermosensory YC3.60 Imaging Matlab Code
This repository subfolder contains Matlab code related to preprocessing and quantification of data collected during thermosensory calcium imaging experiments using the YC3.60 sensor. 
 
 For analysis of experiments in *S. stercoralis* or *C. elegans* AFD, the top-level Matlab script is: TCI_Primary.m
 For analysis of ectopic expression experiments using *C. elegans* ASE, users should preprocess raw data files using TCI_Preprocess.m, then analyze data with TCI_analyzeEctopic.m
